# c2fp
A poorly written library for those who want to convert closures (like std::function and friends) to raw function pointers in a questionable, unsafe, and unportable way. System V x86\_64 only.
## Features
What you see is what you get.
## Development
If you know of ways to make c2fp even more questionable, feel free to submit a pull request. If you know of a more legitimate and safer way to do this, this repository might be too ugly and poorly written for you to work on.
### Dependencies
System V x86\_64.

Oh, you mean libraries? Nah.
### Building
Gently type `make` in your terminal and hit Ctrl+M (on IBM compatible keyboards) or Control+M (on Apple keyboards), or the Return key if you have functional one. Hopefully a file called `libc2fp.so` or `libc2fp.dylib` will gently manifest itself after a moment or two.
## P.A.Q. (Possibly Asked Questions)
#### Why is your code so ugly?
Hey, at least it works (or so I hope).
#### Why are you calling your code ugly? It looks okay to me.
Because C++ isn't exactly pretty, unlike me =^=
#### Your code looks pretty well written. Why are you calling it ugly?
Just in case it is.
